A rock solid contact form that focuses on spam, security and deliverability

== Description ==

Rock Solid Contact Form is the result of years of work, managing a network of Wordpress websites. I built it to work for me, first and foremost.

Rock Solid does not require any form building. Simply place the shortcode [rock-solid-contact] on page, post or widget and it will work.

To improve upon the default, visit the settings pages for Files, Spam and Email. Use SMTP if possible.




 
== Installation ==
 
1. Upload the plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Visit the Settings page and add your email and check the fields you want to show.
1. Place the shortcode [rock-solid-contact] into a page, post or widget.
